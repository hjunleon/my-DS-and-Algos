# Question 1: Days (7 marks)
----------------------------

COVID-19 restrictions have disrupted the routines and
structure of our daily life.  As home-based learning and 
working-from-home become a norm, sometimes, days are 
blended and blurred into one.

To remind ourselves of the passage of time, write a program 
called `days` that reads in two integers from the standard 
input, the first is the month (ranged from 1 to 12, inclusive) 
and the second is the day (ranged from 1 to 31, inclusive). 
The program then prints to the standard output which day of 
the year it is.  For instance, September 14 is the 257th
day of the year.  If the input to `days` is `9 14`, the
program should print `257`.

Assume that the year is not a leap year.

Use a fixed-length array and loops to solve this problem 
instead of conditional statements.  Solutions that use 
conditional statements (in any form) will receive a 0.

Sample Runs
-----------
```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex01-ooiwt$ ./days
1 1
1
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex01-ooiwt$ ./days
9 14
257
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex01-ooiwt$ ./days
12 31
365
```

# Question 2: ID (7 marks)
--------------------------

Your NUS student id has a letter at the end. This letter is
called a check code and is a form of redundancy check used
for detecting errors, especially when your student id is
manually entered into a software application.

Your check code is calculated by:

1. Sum up the digits in your student id. Let the sum be N.
2. Divide N by 13, and take the remainder. Let the remainder
   be R.  
3. Look up the table below:

R  | Check Code
---|------------
0  | Y
1  | X
2  | W
3  | U
4  | R
5  | N
6  | M
7  | L
8  | J
9  | H
10 | E
11 | A
12 | B

Write a program `id.c` that reads in an integer containing
the digits of a student's id from the standard input. Print
out the check code to the standard output.

You can use the `putchar` function to print a single `char`
variable to the standard output.

Use a fixed-length array and loops to solve this problem 
instead of conditional statements.  Solutions that use 
conditional statements (in any form) will receive a 0.

Sample Run
----------
```
ooiwt@pe116:~/as03-ooiwt$ ./id
1933091
Y
ooiwt@pe116:~/as03-ooiwt$ ./id
3364497
E
ooiwt@pe116:~/as03-ooiwt$ ./id
1111111111111
Y
```

Question 3: Max (8 marks)
-------------------------

Write a program max that finds the maximum value from a list
of n integers L.

Instead of doing this with a loop, solve this question with
_recursion_. Write a function

```
long max(const long list[], long start, long end)
{
	:
}
```

that calls itself and return the maximum value among the
array elements list[start] .. list[end - 1]. It should split
the input list into two halves (roughly), find the maximum
of the left half, find the maximum of the right half, and
return the larger of these two maximums.

In the function definition above, the keyword `const` (short
for constant) is used to annotate that the array list is
meant to remain unchanged.

The program should read the following from the standard
inputs:

- The first number is a positive integer n.
- The next n numbers correspond to the list of integers L.

The program should then print to the largest value among
the inputs to the standard output.

n is guaranteed to be less than 10000.  You may use a fixed-
length array on the stack to store the inputs.

Note that you are not allowed to use loops of any kind in
your solution (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  Solutions
that use loops will receive a 0.

Sample Runs
-----------

```
ooiwt@pe116:~/as03-ooiwt$ cat input
5
-5 3 1 8 2
ooiwt@pe116:~/as03-ooiwt$ ./max < input
8
```


Question 4: Padovan (8 marks)
-----------------------------

Padovan numbers are a sequence of numbers defined as
follows:

p(0) = 1
p(1) = 0
p(2) = 0

For n > 2:
  p(n) = p(n-2) + p(n-3)

You might notice the similarity between Padovan numbers 
and Fibonacci numbers.  Padovan numbers are named after 
Richard Padovan, an architect.  Unlike Fibonacci, Padovan
is "only" 88 years old and the sequence is named after him
only recently!

Write a program `padovan` that reads in a non-negative
integer n from the standard input, and writes to the 
standard output, all the Padovan numbers p(n), p(n-1),
.. p(0), in order (one number per line).

n is guaranteed to be 150 or less.

There are 3 marks allocated for efficiency for this 
question.  Avoid repetitively re-calculating the same
sequence of numbers over and over to earn these 3 marks.
